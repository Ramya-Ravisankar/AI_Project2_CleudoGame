"""
This is the main module for the Cluedo game.
It initializes the game, processes user inputs, and manages game actions such as moving, suggesting, and accusing.

Features of the Code :
Game Initialization:
Rooms, characters, weapons, and the solution are initialized correctly, and connections between rooms are established.
This section initializes:
Rooms with connections.
Characters with starting positions.
Weapons without initial locations.
The randomly selected solution.
The game logic and player notes.

The Game State section provides useful information about:
The rooms and their connections.
The characters and their current positions.
The weapons and their locations.
This makes it easy for the player to understand the gameâ€™s current state.

Game Logic Integration:
GameLogic is used to manage gameplay, including movement, suggestions, and accusations.
PlayerNotes is initialized and used to log player suggestions.

PlayerNotes Integration:
Suggestions are logged into PlayerNotes when a suggestion is made
Players can view their notes using the notes action

Game Actions:
The while loop handles all player actions effectively:
Move: Manages movement between connected rooms and provides feedback for invalid moves.
Suggest: Logs suggestions in PlayerNotes and handles refutations through make_suggestion.
Accuse: Validates accusations against the solution and ends the game if correct.
Quit: Exits the game gracefully.
Notes: Displays logged suggestions for reference.Allows players to view logged suggestions.
